    "<h5 class='year'>Self Learning<br />2019 - 2020</h5><br />Having obtained my Bachelor's degree in 2017, I set forth on a transformative expedition to the UK with a dual mission: to forge connections with diverse individuals and to achieve mastery over the English language. By 2020, I had initiated my foray into the realm of programming, marking a significant milestone in my journey.<br /><br /><h5 class='year'>Kresky - Digital Agency<br />2020 - 2022</h5><br />Through various courses, I honed my skills, and it was during this time that a close friend, a seasoned graphic designer with a decade of experience, approached me with an intriguing proposition. He asked if I would be interested in collaborating with him to form a freelancing team. Together, we undertook several commercial projects for clients hailing from Poland, Spain, and Austria. These experiences exposed me to the intricacies of collaborating with designers and effectively communicating with clients. It felt like diving into deep waters, but this plunge allowed me to grasp the art of creating pixel-perfect layouts based on the designs furnished by the designer.<br /><br /><h5 class='year'>GetSavvy - Marketing Agency<br />2022 - Present</h5><br />After approximately 18 months, I landed a full-time junior front-end position at a marketing company headquartered in England. This marked a significant milestone in my career, as it was the first time I collaborated with other developers and cross-functional teams. Right from the first day, I delved into working with the React.js framework, steering away from vanilla front-end technologies. I also acquired proficiency in tools like GIT, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator. Moreover, I embraced the agile workflow, seamlessly integrating it into my daily routine. My projects ranged from internal initiatives catering to the company's needs to maintaining and updating applications for other organizations, as well as undertaking marketing campaigns for esteemed British and international brands.",
